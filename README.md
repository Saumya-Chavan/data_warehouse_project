# data_warehouse_project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics pipeline — from raw data ingestion to generating business-ready insights.
It is designed as a project showcasing best practices in data engineering, data modeling, and analytics using MySQL.

🏗️ Data Architecture
The project follows the Medallion Architecture approach with three distinct layers:

🥉 Bronze Layer
Stores raw data exactly as received from the source systems (ERP & CRM).
Data is ingested from CSV files into MySQL tables.

🥈 Silver Layer
Focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and standardization.
Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
Prepares data for reliable analysis and reporting.

🥇 Gold Layer
Contains business-ready data organized into a Star Schema.
Includes Fact and Dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
Serves as the foundation for dashboards and advanced analytics.

📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data engineering workflow:
Data Architecture – Building a modern warehouse using the Bronze–Silver–Gold layered model.
ETL Pipelines – Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple CSV sources into MySQL.
Data Modeling – Designing fact and dimension tables to support efficient analytics.
Analytics & Reporting – Running SQL-based insights for business metrics and trends.

🎯 Skills Showcased
This project is ideal for showcasing skills in:
🧩 MySQL Development
🏗️ Data Engineering
⚙️ ETL Pipeline Development
🧮 Data Modeling (Star Schema)
📊 Data Analytics & Reporting
💡 SQL Optimization & Query Design

🛠️ Tools & Resources Used
Tool	                Purpose
MySQL	               Database for storing and querying data
MySQL Workbench 	   GUI for designing, managing, and querying the database
CSV Datasets	       Source data files from ERP and CRM systems
EdrawMax             To design data flow, architecture, and schema diagrams
GitHub	             Version control and project collaboration
Notion               Documentation and task management

🚀 Project Requirements
🧱 1. Data Engineering (Building the Data Warehouse)
Objective:
Develop a modern data warehouse in MySQL to consolidate ERP and CRM sales data for analytics.

Specifications:
Data Sources: Two CSV datasets (ERP & CRM systems)
Data Quality: Handle missing, inconsistent, and duplicate records
Integration: Merge datasets into a single analytical model
Scope: Use latest data only (no historical tracking)
Documentation: Include ERD and model diagrams for clear understanding

📊 2. Data Analytics & Reporting
Objective:
Generate SQL-based analytical insights into key business areas such as:
🧍‍♂️ Customer Behavior
📦 Product Performance
💰 Sales and Profit Trends
🌍 Regional or Category Analysis

Deliverables:
Aggregated reports using SQL queries
KPI and trend dashboards (optional in Power BI, Tableau, or Excel)
